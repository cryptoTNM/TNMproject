Waves.Exchange is a hybrid cryptoasset exchange that allows users to transfer, trade, issue, and stake cryptocurrencies. The platform combines the security of decentralized systems with the features of centralized exchanges. Established in 2017 as Waves DEX, Waves.Exchange is now a standalone offering. Waves.Exchange aims to offer fast and secure trading instruments, staking opportunities, low costs, an API, mobile applications, and access to major cryptoassets and 30k+ tokens on the Waves protocol.

According to the Waves team, key features of the exchange include the following:

Secure - Users remain in sole control of their assets. Funds do not leave their wallets and cannot be frozen.
Fast - A matcher service provides rapid order-matching and decentralized exchange on the blockchain, without having access to user accounts.
Easy token issue and management - Token creation costs 1 WAVES and takes 1 minute.
Staking dashboard - Lease WAVES and earn interest from within the exchange.
